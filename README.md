This is a Movie Database System implemented by Java in the BlueJ environment. The aim of the Movie Database System is for a user to keep a database of the movies he owns in his home movie collection, and to perform operations such as searching for movies, adding/deleting movies, displaying the details of movies, etc.

When the program is running, it repeatedly displays a menu with these options: 
(1) Search Movies__
(2) Add Movie 
(3) Delete Movie 
(4) Display Favourite Movies 
(5) Exit System 
(6) Edit Movie

Option (1) allows the user to search for a movie in the database. The user can search by movie title or director/directors.
Option (2) allows the user to add a new movie to the database. 
Option (3) allows the user to delete an existing movie from the database. The user is asked to search the movie by Title. Exact or partial title is to be entered. 
Option (4) allows the user to display a list of movies according to ratings. The user is asked for a number (1-10) representing a rating (higher number indicating better rating), and a list of movies having that rating or higher are displayed. 
Option (5) exits the program. All the movies currently in memory are automatically saved back to "myvideos.txt". 
Option (6) allows the user to edit a movie. The fields which can be edited are the actors and the rating.
